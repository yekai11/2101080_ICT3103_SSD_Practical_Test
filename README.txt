WEBAPP:
NOTE: Sorry prof using react as a front end requires you to manually upload the txt file.

1. Select the u file chooser and upload the txt file found on the local directory
2. type in any password
3. Wait for it to check
4a. If password found page will reload
4b. - If password not found will be redirected to another page with the password you have entered
    - Click on the logout button to return to the homepage

UI Testing:
- I've utilised cypress as a frontend testing tool

Git Server:
- I did not upload the webapp i've made onto the local gitserver but instead it can be found on github: https://github.com/yekai11/2101080_ICT3103_SSD_Practical_Test
